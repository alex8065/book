; We test in two phases:
;
; 1. Check that the generated TypeScript code is what we expect.
;

(rule
 (alias runtest)
 (package atdts)
 (action
   (diff ts-expected/everything.ts
     ts-tests/everything.ts)))

; 2. Run the generated TypeScript code and check that is reads or writes JSON
;    data as expected.
;
; See ts-tests/dune
