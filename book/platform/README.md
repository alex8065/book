# The OCaml Platform

So far in the book, we've gone through a number of techniques you can
use to build real OCaml programs.  We'll now wrap up this part by
examining the tools you can use for editing, compiling, testing,
documenting and publishing your own projects.

The OCaml community has developed a platform of modern tools to interface
it with IDEs such as Visual Studio Code.  All you need to do is to specify
your project metadata (for example, library dependencies and compiler
versions), and the OCaml Platform tools can generate API documentation and
also implement adopt modern software engineering practises such as continuous
integration (CI) and unit or fuzz testing.

## A Hello World OCaml Project

Let's start by creating a sample OCaml project and navigating around
it.  Dune has a basic built-in command to initialize a project
template that is suitable to get us started.


```sh dir=examples/correct/hello,skip
$ dune init proj hello
Success: initialized project component named hello
```

<!-- TODO

This doesn't work for me.  I ran the init command, but the lib and
test are messed up in terms of names. The test is called "hello",
and the library is called "inline_tests", which I think is backwards.

[yminsky@viserion tmp]$ dune init proj hello --ppx ppx_inline_test --inline-tests
Success: initialized project component named hello
[yminsky@viserion tmp]$ cd hello/
[yminsky@viserion hello]$ ls
bin  hello.opam  lib  test
[yminsky@viserion hello]$ cat lib/dune
(library
 (inline_tests)
 (name hello)
 (preprocess
  (pps ppx_inline_test)))
[yminsky@viserion hello]$ cat test/dune
(test
 (name hello)
 (preprocess
  (pps ppx_inline_test)))
[yminsky@viserion hello]$

 -->


Dune will create a `hello/` directory and populate it with a
skeleton OCaml project.  This sample project has the basic metadata
required for us to learn more about the opam package manager and the
dune build tool that we've used earlier in the book.

At this point, we need to use opam to setup our development environment.
You've almost certainly done this already at this point in the book, but
in case you've skipped straight to this chapter we will first initialise
opam's global state.

```
$ opam init
```

By default, opam doesn't require any special user permissions and stores
all of the files it installs in `~/.opam` (such as the current build of
the OCaml compiler if you didn't have one pre-installed when you initialised
opam).  You can run `opam switch` to see all the different sandboxed
environments you have available, and `opam switch create` will let you
construct new ones.

It is also possible to create a "local switch" that stores all the dependencies
within the current project working directory.  Let's do this for our hello
world project next:

<!-- ```sh dir=examples/correct/hello-->
```
$ cd hello
$ opam switch create .
```

This will invoke opam to install the project dependencies (in this case,
just dune as we didn't specify any more when initialising the project).
All of the files from a local switch will be present under `_opam/`
in the working directory.
You can use `opam env` to add the right directories to your local shell path
so that you can invoke locally installed tools:

```
$ eval $(opam env)
```

If you prefer not to modify your shell configuration, then you can
also invoke commands via `opam exec` to modify the path for
the subcommand specified in the remainder of the command line.

##### Choosing an OCaml compiler version

<!-- TODO: This feels a little hard to follow.

     Maybe it would be good to start this off by explaining what [opam
     switch create .] does, which I think is to just use the same
     compiler setup that's present in the currently active switch.

     The point of this chunk then is to say that sometimes you want to
     specify a particular compiler version, and here's how you do
     that. The first question is, what versions are available, which
     lets you explain `list-available`, and the narrative goes from there.
  -->

When you want to select a particular version of the OCaml compiler,
you can use `opam switch list-available` to get a set of versions.
You'll notice that there are three different types of OCaml compiler
packages.

<!-- TODO: This sounds a bit too active, maybe?  Instead, consider:

    `ocaml-system` is the name opam uses for the pre-existing version
    of the OCaml compiler that was already installed on your machine.
    This compiler is always fast to install since nothing needs to be
    compiled for it.

-->

`ocaml-system` detects a pre-existing version of the OCaml compiler
on your machine, and installs a wrapper package of that particular
version. This is a fast operation since nothing needs to be compiled.
The only thing you need to do to create a system switch is to have
the right version of OCaml already installed (e.g. via `apt` or
Homebrew) and to pass the same version to the switch creation as an
additional argument. For example, if you have OCaml 4.13.1 installed:

```
$ opam switch create . 4.13.1
```

<!-- TODO: This is a little confusing! Are you saying that if 4.13.1
     is installed, and you ask to build 4.13.1, it will...just rebuild
     it from scratch?  If so, why did you say "if you have OCaml
     4.13.1 installed"?  Wouldn't the same be true for any version of
     OCaml you want to install?  Maybe you meant to say:

       For example, if you have OCaml 4.13.1 installed, then running
       this command:

       ```
       $ opam switch create . 4.13.1
       ```

       will install the system compiler into your local switch.

     Perhaps related, but I don't know what `ocaml-base-compiler` is
     doing in the following sentence.
-->

`ocaml-base-compiler` builds a switch-local copy of that OCaml version
from scratch.  It can take a little longer than `ocaml-system`,
but you have much more flexibility about the choice of versions.
The default operation of `opam switch create` is to calculate the latest
supported compiler version from your project metadata and use that one for the
local switch.

<!-- TODO: Maybe the above would be clearer with an example of how to
     use ocaml-base-compiler, much as we have an example of using
     ocaml-variants. -->

`ocaml-variants` is used when you need to add custom configuration options
to the compiler, such as `flambda`.  In this case, you can also install
`ocaml-options-*` packages alongside `ocaml-variants` to activate
those configuration flags.  For example, if you wanted to use the `flambda`
inliner with your package, you would:

```sh skip
$ opam switch create . ocaml-variants.4.13.1+options ocaml-option-flambda
```

You can see the full set of option packages by using:

```sh skip
$ opam search ocaml-option
```

:::

### Structure of an OCaml project

Back in [Files Modules And
Programs](files-modules-and-programs.html#files-modules-and-programs){data-type=xref},
we looked at what a simple program with a couple of OCaml modules
looks like. Let's now look at the set of files in our `hello/`
application to examine a fuller project structure.

```
├── dune-project
├── hello.opam
├── lib
│   └── dune
├── bin
│   ├── dune
│   └── main.ml
└── test
    ├── dune
    └── hello.ml
```

Some observations about this structure:

- The `dune-project` file marks the root of the project, and is used
  for writing down some key metadata for the project (more on that
  later).

- The `hello.opam` file contains metadata for registering this
  software as an opam project. As we'll see, we won't need to edit
  this manually because we can generate the file via `dune`.

- There are three source directories, each with its own `dune` file
  specifying the build parameters for that part of the codebase.  The
  trio of `lib`, `bin` and `test` makes good sense for a project that
  is primarily an executable, rather than a reusable library.  In that
  case, you would generally use these libraries as follows:

  - The `lib` directory would contain the bulk of the source.
  - The `bin` directory would contain a thin wrapper on top of the
    code in `lib` which actually launches the executable.
  - The `test` directory has the bulk of the tests for `lib`, which,
    following the advice in
    [Testing](testing.html#where-should-tests-go){data-type=xref}, are
    in a separate directory from the source.

Now we'll talk about the different parts of this structure in more
detail.

### Defining module names

Individual `ml` and `mli` files each define OCaml modules, named after the file
and capitalised. Modules names are the only name you refer to within OCaml code.

Let's create a `Msg` module in our skeleton project inside `lib/`.

```
$ echo 'let greeting = "Hello World"' > lib/msg.ml
$ echo 'val greeting : string' > lib/msg.mli
```

A valid OCaml module name cannot contain dashes or other special
characters other than underscores.

### Defining libraries as collections of modules

One or more OCaml modules can be gathered together into a *library*,
providing a convenient way to package up multiple dependencies with a
single name. A project usually puts the business logic of the application
into a library rather than directly into an executable binary, since
this makes writing tests and documentation easier in addition to
improving reusability.  [libraries/defining libraries]{.idx}
Let's look at `lib/dune` in more detail:

<!-- TODO: This isn't what the file looks like, is it? Since we no longer -->
<!-- have the ppx-declarations in the "dune init" invocation.  Also, -->
<!-- we're not going to add any tests inline in msg.ml, so, maybe we -->
<!-- just don't need it? -->

```
(library
 (inline_tests)
 (name hello)
 (preprocess
  (pps ppx_inline_test)))
```

By default, dune exposes libraries as *wrapped* under a single module,
and the `name` field determines the name of that module.  In our
example project `msg.ml` is defined in `lib/dune` which defines a `hello`
library. Thus, users of our newly defined module can access it as
`Hello.Msg`.  You can read more about wrapping and module aliases in
[The Compiler Frontend Parsing And Type Checking](compiler-frontend.html#wrapping-libraries-with-module-aliases){data-type=xref}.

Although our example library only currently contains a single `Msg` module,
it is common to have multiple modules per library. Other modules within
the `hello` library can simply refer to `Msg`. You must refer to library names
in a `dune` file when deciding what libraries to link in, and never individual
module names.  You can query the installed libraries in your current switch
via `ocamlfind list` at your command prompt, after running
`opam install ocamlfind` to install it if necessary.

If there's a `public_name` field present in the `dune` library definition,
this determines the publically exposed name for the library, which is what
you use via the `libraries` field in the dune file.  Without a public name,
the defined library is local to the current dune project only.
The `(libraries)` field in the `lib/dune` file is empty since this
is a trivial standalone library.

### Writing test cases for a library

Our next step is to define a test case in `test/dune` for our library.
We can define inline tests within our library as we did earlier in
[Testing](testing.html#testing){data-type=xref}.

<!-- $MDX file=examples/correct/hello/lib/msg.ml -->
```
open Base

let greeting = "Hello World"

let%test "size" =
  String.length greeting = 11
```

We can also define more elaborate executable tests inside the `test/`
directory as well. The `(test)` dune field builds an executable binary
that is run when you invoke `dune runtest` (along with any inline tests
defined within libraries).  In our project, the `test/hello.ml`
module defines the executable test cases. We'll also add a dependency
on our locally defined `hello` library so that we can access it.

<!-- TODO: This doesn't work, though! inline tests are sadly not
     currently supported with the test stanza.  I propose we:

     - stick a reasonable template in, which, in particular, doesn't
       use the test stanza, since that won't work for inline tests.

     - put our example inline test in the test directory, rather than
       the lib directory, since that's generally the recommended
       style.

     - Have as near-future work (before the book is published) to fix
       the dune template generation to generate a library instead of a
       test stanza if -inline-tests is requested.

     - down the line, we should fix the dune test stanza to support
       inline tests. (We want this internally at JS too.)
-->

<!-- $MDX file=examples/correct/hello/test/dune -->
```scheme
(test
 (name hello)
 (libraries hello))
```

Once you run the tests via `dune runtest`, you can find the built
artefacts in `_build/default/test/` in your project checkout.

### Building an executable program

Finally, we want to actually use our hello world from the
command-line. This is defined in `bin/dune` in a very similar fashion
to test cases.

```scheme
(executable
 (public_name hello)
 (name main)
 (libraries hello)))
```

There has to be a `bin/hello.ml` alongside the `bin/dune` file
that represents the entry module for the executable. Only that
module and the modules and libraries it depends on will be linked
into the executable. Much like libraries, the `(name)` field
here has to adhere to OCaml module naming conventions, and the
`public_name` field represents the binary name that is installed
onto the system and just needs to be a valid Unix or Windows filename.

Now try modifying `bin/main.ml` to refer to our  `Hello.Msg` module:

```
let () = print_endline Hello.Msg.greeting
```

You can build and execute the command locally using `dune exec` and
the local name of the executable.
You can also find the built executable in `_build/default/bin/main.exe`.


```sh dir=examples/correct/hello,skip
$ dune build
$ dune exec -- bin/main.exe
Hello World
```

You can also refer to the public name of the executable if its
more convenient.

```sh dir=examples/correct/hello,skip
$ dune exec -- hello
Hello World
```

## Setting up an integrated development environment

Now that we've seen the basic structure of the OCaml project, it's
time to setup an integrated development environment. An IDE is
particularly useful for use with OCaml due to the extra information
you gain from the static type information present in the codebase. A
good IDE will provide you with the facilities to browse interface
documentation, see inferred types for code, and to jump to the
definitions of external modules.

### Using Visual Studio Code

The recommended IDE for newcomers to OCaml is [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) using the [OCaml Platform
plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform).
The plugin uses the Language Server Protocol to communicate with your
opam and dune environment. All you need to do is to install the OCaml
LSP server via opam:

```
opam install ocaml-lsp-server
```

Once installed, the VSCode OCaml plugin will ask you which opam
switch to use. Just the default one should be sufficient get you
going with building and browsing your interfaces.

### Browsing interface documentation

The OCaml LSP server understands how to interface with dune and
examine the build artifacts (such as the typed `.cmt` interface files), so
opening your local project in VS Code is sufficient to activate all the
features.  Try navigating over to `bin/main.ml`, where you will see the
invocation to the `hello` library.

<!-- $MDX file=examples/correct/hello/bin/main.ml -->
```
let () = print_endline Hello.Msg.greeting
```

First perform a build of the project to generate the type annotation
files. Then hover your mouse over the `Hello.Msg.greeting` function -- you
should see some documentation pop up about the function and its
arguments.  This information comes from the _docstrings_ written into
the `msg.mli` interface file in the `hello` library.

Modify the `msg.mli` interface file to contain some signature documentation
as follows:

<!-- $MDX file=examples/correct/hello/lib/msg.mli -->
```
(** This is a docstring, as it starts with "(**", as opposed to normal comments
    that start with a single star.

    The top-most docstring of the module should contain a description of the
    module, what it does, how to use it, etc.

    The function-specific documentation located below the function signatures. *)

val greeting : string

(** This is the docstring for the [greeting] function.

    A typical documentation for this function would be:

    Returns a greeting message.

    {4 Examples}

    {[ print_endline greeting ]} *)
```

Documentation strings are parsed by the
[odoc](https://github.com/ocaml/odoc) tool to generate HTML and PDF
documentation from a collection of opam packages.  If you intend your
code to be used by anyone else (or indeed, by yourself a few months
later) you should take the time to annotate your OCaml signature files
with documentation.  An easy way to preview the HTML documentation is
to build it locally with dune:

```skip
$ opam install odoc
$ dune build @doc
```

This will leave the HTML files in `_build/default/_doc/_html`, which
you can view normally with a webbrowser.

### Autoformatting your source code

As you develop more OCaml code, you'll find it convenient to have it
formatted to a common style.  The `ocamlformat` tool can help you do
this easily from within VSCode.

```skip
$ echo 'version=0.20.1' > .ocamlformat
$ opam install ocamlformat.0.20.1
```

The `.ocamlformat` file controls the autoformatting options available,
and fixes the version of the tool that is used. You can upgrade to a
newer ocamlformat version whenever you want, but it is a manual
process to avoid an upstream release auto-reformatting your project
code without your intervention.  You can examine the formatting
options via `ocamlformat --help` -- most of the time the defaults
should be fine.

Once you've got ocamlformat configured, you can either format your
project from within VSCode (`shift-alt-F` being the default), or by
running:

```skip
$ dune build @fmt
```

This will generate a set of reformatted files in the build directory,
which you can accept with `dune promote` as you did earlier in the
testing chapter.

## Publishing your code online

With your IDE all set up you'll quickly develop useful OCaml code and
want to share it with others.  We'll now go through how to define
opam packages, set up continuous integration and publish your code.

### Defining opam packages

The only metadata file that is really _required_ to participate in the
open-source OCaml ecosystem is an `opam` file in your source tree.  Each `opam`
file defines a *package* -- a collection of OCaml libraries and executable
binaries or application data.  Each opam package can define dependencies on
other opam packages, and includes build and testing directions for your
project.  This is what's installed when you eventually publish the package and
someone else types in `opam install hello`.

A collection of `opam` files can be stored in an *opam repository* to
create a package database, with a central one for the OCaml ecosystem
available at <https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository>.  The official
(but not exclusive) tool used for manipulating `opam` files is the
eponymous [opam package manager](https://opam.ocaml.org) that we've
been using throughout this book.

::: {data-type=note}
##### How do we name OCaml modules, libraries and packages?

Much of the time, the module, library, and package names are all the
same.  The same name can often be used for the library and the package.
But there are reasons for these names to be distinct as well:

- Some libraries are exposed as multiple top-level modules, which
  means you need to pick a different name for referring to that
  collection of modules.
- Even when the library has a single top-level module, you might want
  the library name to be different from the module name to avoid name
  clashes at the library level.
- Package names might differ from library names if a package combines
  multiple libraries and/or binaries together.

It's important to understand the difference between modules, libraries and
packages as you work on bigger projects. These can easily have thousands of
modules, hundreds of libraries and dozens of opam packages in a single
codebase.

:::

### Generating project metadata from dune

The `hello.opam` file in our sample project is currently empty, but you don't
need to write it by hand -- instead, we can define our project metadata using
the dune build system and have the opam file autogenerated for us. The root
directory of an OCaml project built by dune has a `dune-project` file that
defines the project metadata. In our example project, it starts with:

```scheme
(lang dune 2.9)
```

The line above is the version of the syntax used in your build files,
and _not_ the actual version of the `dune` binary.  One of the nicest
features of dune is that it is forwards-compatible with older
metadata. By defining the version of the dune language that you are
currently using, _future_ versions of dune will do their best to
emulate the current behaviour until you chose to upgrade your project.

The rest of the `dune-project` file defines other useful project metadata:

```scheme
(name hello)
(documentation "https://username.github.io/hello/")
(source (github username/hello))
(license ISC)
(authors "Your name")
(maintainers "Your name")
(generate_opam_files true)
```

The fields in here all represent project metadata ranging from textual
descriptions, to project URLs, to other opam package dependencies.
Go ahead and edit the metadata above to reflect your own details, and
then build the project:

```skip
$ dune build
```

The build command will update the `hello.opam` file in your source
tree as well, keeping it in sync with your changes.  The final part of
the `dune-project` file contains dependency information for other
packages your project depends on.

```scheme
(package
 (name hello)
 (synopsis "A short description of the project")
 (description "A short description of the project")
 (depends
  (ocaml (>= 4.08.0))
  (alcotest :with-test)
  (odoc :with-doc)))
```

The `(package)` stanza here refers to opam packages, both for the name
and for the dependency specifications.  This is in contrast to the
`dune` files which refer to ocamlfind libraries, since those represent
the compilation units for OCaml code (whereas opam packages are
broader collections of package data).

Notice that the dependency specification can also include version
information. One of the key features of opam is that each repository
contains multiple versions of the same package.  The opam CLI contains
a constraint solver that will find versions of all dependencies that
are compatible with your current project.  When you add a dependency,
you can therefore specify lower and upper version bounds as required
by your use of that package.  The `with-test` and `with-doc` are
further constraints that only add those dependencies for test and
documentation generation respectively.

Once you've defined your opam and dune dependencies, you can run
various lint commands to check that your metadata is consistent.

```skip
$ opam dune-lint
$ opam lint
```

The `opam-dune-lint` plugin will check that the ocamlfind libraries
and opam packages in your dune files match up, and offer to fix them
up if it spots a mismatch. `opam lint` runs additional checks on the
opam files within your project.


### Setting up Continuous Integration

Once you have your project metadata defined, it's a good time to begin
hosting it online.  Two of the most popular platforms for this are
[GitHub](https://github.com) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).  The
remainder of this chapter will assume you are using GitHub for
simplicity, although you are encouraged to check out the alternatives
to find the best solution for your own needs.

When you create a GitHub repository and push your code to it, you can
also add an OCaml GitHub Action that will install the OCaml Platform
tools and run your code across various architectures and operating
systems.  You can find the full documentation online at the [GitHub
Setup OCaml](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/set-up-ocaml)
marketplace.  Configuring an action is as simple as adding a
`.github/workflows/test.yml` file to your project that looks something
like this:

```yaml
name: Hello world workflow
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os:
          - macos-latest
          - ubuntu-latest
          - windows-latest
        ocaml-compiler:
          - 4.13.x
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use OCaml ${{ matrix.ocaml-compiler }}
        uses: ocaml/setup-ocaml@v2
        with:
          ocaml-compiler: ${{ matrix.ocaml-compiler }}
      - run: opam install . --deps-only --with-test
      - run: opam exec -- dune build
      - run: opam exec -- dune runtest
```

This workflow file will run your project on OCaml installations on
Windows, macOS and Linux, using the latest patch release of OCaml
4.13.  Notice that it also runs the test cases you have defined
earlier on all those different operating systems as well.  You can do
an awful lot of customisation of these continuous integration
workflows, so refer to the online documentation for more options.

### Other conventions

There are a few other files you may also want to add to a project
to match common conventions:

- a `Makefile` contains targets for common actions such as `all`,
  `build`, `test` or `clean`. While you don't need this when using
  VSCode, some other operating system package managers might benefit
  from having one present.
- the `LICENSE` defines the terms under which your code is made
  available. Our example defaults to the permissive ISC license, and
  this is generally a safe default unless you have specific plans
  for your project.
- a `README.md` is a Markdown-formatted introduction to your library
  or application.
- a `.gitignore` file contains the patterns for generated files from
  the OCaml tools so that they can be ignored by the Git version
  control software.  If you're not familiar with using Git, look over
  one of the tutorials one such as GitHub's [git hello
  world](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

### Releasing your code into the opam repository

Once your continuous integration is passing, you are all set to try to
tag a release of your project and share it with other users!  The
OCaml Platform supplies a convenient tool called `dune-release` which
automates much of this process for you.

```skip
$ opam install dune-release
```

The first thing you need to do is to create a `CHANGES.md` file in
your project in Markdown format, which contains a header per version.
This is typically a succinct summary of the changes between versions
that can be read by users.  For our first release, we might have:

```
## v1.0.0

- Initial public release of our glorious hello world
  project (@avsm)
- Added test cases for making sure we do in fact hello world.
```

Commit this file to your repository in the root. Before you proceed
with a release, you need to make sure that all of your local changes
have been pushed to the remote GitHub repository, and that your
working tree is clean.  You can do this by using git:

```
$ git clean -dxf
$ git diff
```

This will remove any untracked files from the local checkout (such as
the `_build` directory) and check that tracked files are unmodified.
We should now be ready to perform the release!  First create a git tag
to mark this release:

```skip
$ dune-release tag
```

This will parse your `CHANGES.md` file and figure out the latest
version, and create a local git tag in your repository after prompting
you. Once that succeeds, you can start the release process via:

```skip
$ dune-release
```

This will begin an interactive session where you will need to enter
some GitHub authentication details (via creating a personal access
token).  Once that is completed, the tool will run all local tests,
generate documentation and upload it to your GitHub pages branch for
that project, and finally offer to open a pull request to the central
opam-repository.  Recall that the central opam package set is all just
a normal git repository, and so your opam file will be added to that
and your GitHub account will create a PR.

At this point, you can sit back and relax while the central opam
repository test system runs your package through a battery of
installations (including on exotic architectures you might not access
to, such as S390X mainframes or 32-bit ARMv7).  If there is a problem
detected, some friendly maintainers from the OCaml community will
comment on the pull request and guide you through how to address it.
You can simply delete the git tag and re-run the release process until
the package is merged.  Once it is merged, you can navigate to the
<ocaml.org> site and view it online in an hour or so.  It will also be
available in the central repository for other users to install.

##### Creating lock files for your projects

Before you publish a project, you might also want to create an
opam lock file to include with the archive. A lock file records
the exact versions of all the transitive opam dependencies at
the time you generate it.  All you need to do is to run:

```sh skip
$ opam lock
```

This generates a `pkgname.opam.locked` file which contains
the same metadata as your original file, but with all the dependencies
explictly listed.  Later on, if a user wants to reconstruct your exact opam
environment (as opposed to the package solution they might calculate with a
future opam repository), then they can pass an option during installation:

```sh skip
$ opam install pkgname --locked
$ opam switch create . --locked
```

Lock files are an optional but useful step to take when releasing your
project to the Internet.

## Learning more from real projects

There's a lot more customisation that happens in any real project, and we can't
cover every aspect in this book. The best way by far to learn more is to dive
in and compile an already established project, and perhaps even contribute to
it. There are thousands of libraries and executable projects released on the
opam repository which you can find online at <https://ocaml.org>.

A selection of some include:

- `patdiff` is an OCaml implementation of the patience diff algorithm,
  and is a nice self-contained CLI project using Core. <https://github.com/janestreet/patdiff>
- The source code to this book is published as a self-contained monorepo
  with all the dependencies bundled together, for convenient compilation.
  <https://github.com/realworldocaml/book>
- Flow is a static typechecker for JavaScript written in OCaml that uses
  Base and works on macOS, Windows and Linux.  It's a good example of a large,
  cross-platform CLI-driven tool. <https://github.com/facebook/flow>
- Octez is an OCaml implementation of a proof-of-stake blockchain called Tezos,
  which contains a [comprehensive collection](https://tezos.gitlab.io/shell/the_big_picture.html#packages)
  of libraries that such as interpreters for a stack language, and a shell that uses Lwt
  to provide networking, storage and cryptographic communications to the outside world. <https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos>
- MirageOS is a library operating system written in OCaml, that can compile code to a
  variety of embedded and hypervisor targets. There are 100s of libraries all written
  using dune in a variety of ways available at <https://github.com/mirage>.
- You can find a number of standalone OCaml libraries for unicode, parsing and computer
  graphics and OS interaction over at <https://erratique.ch/software>.
